## Introduction 
I have made a credit card fraud detection model using tensorflow. For this I have used the following dataset
Dataset :- "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection"

First I have downloaded the complete data and balaances the data for equal learning of fraud and non-fraud data.

I have created 3 models 2 of which is based ikn CNN and the other model is based on Binary Neural Network Classfication.

The final model with most accuracy is model 1 which is based on CNN without using MAXPOOL layer.


Thanks for reading.
Kindly suggest me the updates.
